The year 2024 has been a wonderful, hectic and exicting as well. It was a year marked by significant milestones, growth opportunities, and valuable experiences that pushed me to excel in various domains.

<h3 id="from-testing-to-learning">From Testing to Learning: My Journey Through Two Worlds</h3>

The first half of 2024 immersed me in the world of performance testing at **PT Bank Mandiri**. Tools like <CustomLink href={'https://jmeter.apache.org/'}>JMeter</CustomLink>, <CustomLink href={'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoadRunner'}>LoadRunner</CustomLink>, and <CustomLink href={'https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira'}>Jira</CustomLink>, which I had never heard of before, became my tools for testing. This was my first time working in an office. I was very nervous at first but also excited, as I met many seniors who guided me and my friend throughout our 6-month internship here.

Then came a complete shift in perspective when I joined **Good News From Indonesia** as a frontend development intern. Gone were the days of breaking systems; instead, I was building them from the ground up. I dove into the world of Next.js and modern frontend architecture, where every pixel and interaction mattered.

In parallel, I joined **Bangkit Academy**, a program led by Google, Gojek, and Tokopedia, specializing in the **Cloud Computing** track. This program provided a unique opportunity to deepen my understanding of cloud technologies and tackle real-world challenges through project-based learning.

One of the standout moments was developing **TerraVision**, a capstone project aimed at predicting house prices using machine learning. Collaborating with a diverse team members with different background, we designed an application that utilized cloud-based infrastructure for data processing and deployment. This project tested my ability to integrate technical expertise in cloud computing with cross-functional teamwork to deliver an impactful solution.

<h3 id="embracing-new-technologies">Embracing New Technologies: A Journey of Continuous Learning</h3>

"You never really understand a technology until you've broken it and rebuilt it," became my mantra throughout the year. Beyond my internship work and Bangkit Academy, I embarked on a personal journey to broaden my technical horizons. I set myself a challenge: learn one new technology or framework each month.

This self-directed learning led me through a fascinating progression of technologies. I started with mastering React's advanced patterns, then moved on to exploring the capabilities of Node.js and Nest.js for backend development. Each new technology opened doors to new possibilities and ways of thinking about software development.

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned (The Hard Way)</h3>

The most valuable lessons rarely come from success stories. They come from those moments when everything goes wrong, and you have to find a way forward. Like the time during my performance testing internship when I had to explain to stakeholders why their system couldn't handle the load they expected. It taught me that technical expertise needs to be balanced with the ability to communicate complex issues in simple terms.

Another pivotal moment came during Bangkit, where the iterative nature of project development often clashed with tight deadlines. These experiences taught me resilience and the importance of clear communication to ensure alignment among team members.

<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead: 2025 and Beyond</h3>

As I step into 2025, I'm not just carrying forward technical skills and project experiences. I'm bringing with me the confidence that comes from overcoming real challenges, the humility that comes from learning from mistakes, and the excitement of knowing there's still so much to learn.

My goals for 2025? They're ambitious but clear:

    Dive deeper into emerging technologies like WebAssembly and edge computing
    Master cloud-native development practices and containerization
    Contribute to open-source projects that make a difference in developers' lives

The complex performance testing scenarios that intimidated me at the start of 2024? They now feel like stepping stones to bigger challenges. After all, in the world of software development, every error message is just a lesson waiting to be learned.

Here's to another year of learning, growing, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code!
